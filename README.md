# ERP-Durchsicht (ERP-throughsight)
I was kind of disappointed in the ERP-Systems i had to use in my worklife and thought to myself "how hard can it be". Well, guess i'm gonna find out

my approach will be to make an ERP-System:
  -that will lock somewhat like a browser,
  -is intuitive to use, so that even someone with no experience can use it (at least the basic funktions),
  -is pretty flexible in the way to use it, so that one can "cheat" in the process of entering an retrieving Data, while retainig dataintegrity, because everything will only in theory be Systematic. The reality often showed, that something needs to be done without the hassle of staying with Protocol
  -will need as little input as possible, to garantee Joy while using the Programm
  -LOOKS BETTER THAN SOMETHING MADE BEFORE WIN XP (honestly, i have used "ERP-Systems" that looked so outdated. If one dared to scroll down-/upwards, there was this refreshing-flickering-Problem reminding me of my first PC AND when asked "how old is this thing? Bet u can't really change it, because it is so wired in the whole company or are you to cheap to invest" they reply with "no this one was installed last Year and did cost the company ~500.000,00â‚¬". I had no words to say that day)
  -makes acsessing Data very Easy
  -maybe some kind of Bookmarking-System?
  -will be focosed to serve "Prodution Companys" but should be able to use it fairly versitile, like for trading, shipping, Service,...


I will use mostly 
  -Python for the Processing (i only know that one)
  -MongoDB for the Data-base (so that the Data is quickly accesseble and a little bit more flexible (than for example MYSQL), so I could change/Upgrade the System even when a company is already using it)
